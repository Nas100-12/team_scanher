      ScanHer is a health-tech innovation built to fight late-stage cancer
      diagnoses among women in Liberia and across Africa. We believe that every
      woman — no matter where she lives — deserves access to affordable, timely,
      and life-saving screenings for breast and cervical cancer. Our solution
      combines portable devices, AI-powered detection, and community outreach to
      bring early cancer screening closer to women, especially in underserved
      areas. By equipping nurses and clinics with the right tools, we bridge the
      diagnostic gap and give women a chance to act early.

        Our Story
      </h3>
      <div class="flex flex-col gap-10">
        <p>
          In Liberia, more than 70% of cervical cancer cases are detected at
          late stages, when treatment is costly and less effective. Rural
          clinics often lack the power, equipment, and specialists needed for
          proper screenings. Social stigma and low awareness make the problem
          worse.
        </p>
        <p>
          ScanHer was born out of this urgent need. Developed under the Orange
          Summer Challenge Liberia Edition, our project is designed to break
          these barriers — turning a smartphone into a life-saving tool through
          innovative imaging, AI analysis, and nurse-led outreach.
